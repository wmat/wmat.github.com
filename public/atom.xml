<h2>January</h2>

<p>January began with a wimper.  After a fun holiday season, I finally got serious about striving to attain my goals mid-month.  This blog post is the documentation of the latter.</p>

<p>After losing 30 pounds in 2012 and improving my overall health and diet by moving to a Paleo/slow-carb way of eating, I&#8217;d managed to let things slip and by mid-January had gained back 8lbs.  The weight gain was no mystery, as I&#8217;d been drinking quite a bit of beer and had let my way of eating slip.  As a measure of my fitness, I&#8217;d been running a familiar 10KM route throughout 2012 and had seen my time for that run decrease to below 50 minutes at it&#8217;s best.  On January 13th, I ran that same route in 1:01:30.</p>

<p>Disappointed in myself, I decided to commit to run a minumum of 3 days per week</p>
