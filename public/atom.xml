    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I happened to read  the following blog post, written by David Caoin on his blog <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2013/01/you-dont-want-to-be-typical/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Raptitudecom+%28Raptitude.com%29">Raptitude.com</a>.  As blogs posts of this type typically do, it struck a nerve with me.  The difference today is that I&#8217;m talking action as a result.</p>

<p>Of particular relevance in the post are thoughts such as &#8220;it took me a long time to learn that typical is no good&#8221;.  Or &#8220;having higher standards than what&#8217;s typical doesn&#8217;t mean you thing you&#8217;re better than everyone else.  It only means everyone is running way below their capability, and you want to make up some of the distance&#8221;.</p>

<p>So what is atypical for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to build</li>
</ol>

<h2>January</h2>

<p>January began with a wimper.  After a fun holiday season, I finally got serious about striving to attain my goals mid-month.  This blog post is the documentation of the latter.</p>

<p>After losing 30 pounds in 2012 and improving my overall health and diet by moving to a Paleo/slow-carb way of eating, I&#8217;d managed to let things slip and by mid-January had gained back 8lbs.  The weight gain was no mystery, as I&#8217;d been drinking quite a bit of beer and had let my way of eating slip.  As a measure of my fitness, I&#8217;d been running a familiar 10KM route throughout 2012 and had seen my time for that run decrease to below 50 minutes at it&#8217;s best.  On January 13th, I ran that same route in 1:01:30.</p>

<p>Disappointed in myself, I decided to commit to run a minumum of 3 days per week.  I also joined <a href="http://everydaylegendary.com">EverdayLegendary</a> and began using the forum.</p>
