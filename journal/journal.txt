I know what I need to do.  It won't be easy but it will save my life.

1.  Quit drinking like it's your job.
2.  Never smoke again.
3.  Eat clean, perhaps start with Paleo so that T and the kids will eat what I cook.  Potentially transition to full carnivore eventually.
4.  Begin content creation with the goal of generating revenue from it eventually.

OK, so if the goal is to make as much money as fast as possible and pay off all debt, how do I do that?  Content creation?

Total debt today is approximately: $536,000.00 pr approximately $397,000.00 USD after taxes.
